Metamask SmartDonate
Metamask SmartDonate is a Metamask Snap that allows people to transparently donate to verified charities. It was created for the EthSamba23 hackathon. The front-end was built using React, and the smart contract was written in Solidity and deployed on the Goerli testnet.

Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to have the Metamask browser extension installed on your browser. You can then visit the EthSamba23 website and select a charity that you would like to donate to.

To donate to the selected charity, you can enter the amount of ETH that you want to donate and click the "Donate" button. Metamask will prompt you to confirm the transaction, and once you confirm, the ETH will be sent to the smart contract.

The smart contract will then convert the donated ETH to USD using the latest ETH/USD exchange rate, and send the equivalent USD amount to the recipient charity.
